Why readable, intentional code matters more than clever shortcuts.

---

Clean code is not about showing how smart you are.  
It is about making your intent obvious to the next person who reads it.

Over time, I’ve learned that clarity beats cleverness. Variable names, small functions, and predictable structure reduce mental load and prevent bugs.

Good code reads like a well-edited essay. You should be able to scan it and understand the story without decoding tricks or hidden logic.
