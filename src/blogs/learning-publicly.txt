Sharing progress openly accelerates growth more than perfection ever will.

Learning in public forces honesty. You can’t hide gaps in understanding when others are watching.

Posting unfinished ideas, experiments, and failures helped me learn faster than waiting until things felt perfect.

Progress compounds when feedback comes early. The goal is not polish, but momentum.
